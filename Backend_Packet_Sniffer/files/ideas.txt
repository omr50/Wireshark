Creating UDP Timestamps field:
    - basically UDP conversation is defined by a 4 tuple (src ip, src port, dest ip, dest port)
    - since that is unique, use that as a key for a hash table
    - after receiving a UDP datagram check if the tuple exists
        - if not, then create a new entry with the timestamp of the datagram as the first one
        - if it already exist, replace the "prev" timestamp with the current one


Following a UDP Stream:
    - Again the 4 tuple can be used to keep track of the Stream
    - Following a UDP stream doesn't gather all like a TCP stream 
    - simply gathers all of them and displays in order of arrival
    - Conversation table (hash map) that can map 4 tuple to list of payloads 
    - get all datagrams for the 4 tuple, and display in chronological order
    - client->server and server->client messages may be displayed in different colors  
    - may not be coherent since UDP doesn't guarantee delivery or order  
    - Also if you follow UDP stream, filter the main view as well to only show packets of this stream 
    - These ideas can be extended to TCP when it comes time for that, but TCP stream would be more coherent
    - Have an id field on backend and when sending to frontend, keep track of that so that you can follow the
      stream better and when clicking on packets in the stream window, you can find the related packet in the 
      window easily by its id.

    - How to send?
    - we have an id, but as we follow the stream, more packets may come, so we need to 
      update frequently, but we don't want to send the entire stream everytime, or make
      a more complex algorithm for only sending the latest one that wasn't sent before,
    - the client should request the stream (maybe on a timer) as long as the screen showing
      the stream is open. So maybe every 5 seconds it can update by sending a request to the
      server for the ids of the packets that are in the stream, and then we can easily use that
      info to retrieve the total info on the front end and then display it, instead of sending all 
      that data again every time.
